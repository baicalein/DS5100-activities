What is the most recent film I watched and enjoyed?

Well, with a 19-month old, I don't get too many opportunities to watch movies. However, one night he fell asleep early so my wife and I watched "Anyone But You," which had just been added to netflix. As someone who doesn't like romantic comedies, I was surprised to have actually enjoyed it. Maybe it's just because I haven't been able to watch a movie all the way through in a while though haha.a
